#### HTML5 Hide/Show
[HTML5 Hide/Show](http://html5doctor.com/the-details-and-summary-elements/)

The HTML5 hide/show code is not presently supported by IE Explorer.  Both Chrome and Firefox, on the other hand, properly hide and show sections.  Also, this code works in RMarkdown when knitting to a .html document but does not work when knitting to Markdown.  When using this code in a Jupyter Notebook, export it to Markdown.  Place the .html code in two sections, one above and one below the section to be hidden and displayed.
