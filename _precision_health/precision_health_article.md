*It takes a research system to achieve reproducibility: Designing an integrated system to support precision health researchers*

The opportunity is for academic research libraries to design and develop integrated research systems for our clients.  Most organizations in the scientific computing space offer training in specific tools such as GitHub, Python, or R -- the Carpentries being the most prominent player.  However, few talk about integrating the pieces into a whole which is greater than the sum of its parts.  In other words, primary investigators today must not only master the technical details of the tools they use but they must also act as system designers, ensuring that workflow processes are properly designed and maintained.  It is rare that one uses a tool in isolation.  Normally a variety of tools must be configured to work together.  For example, RStudio supports the creation of projects but one also needs to track versions of project components in GitHub or similar system.
