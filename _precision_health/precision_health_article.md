*The reproducibility machine: Designing an integrated big data research system to support precision health researchers*

### The 21st Century Public Health Research System
The opportunity is for academic research libraries to design and develop integrated research systems for our clients.  Most organizations in the scientific computing space offer training in specific tools such as GitHub, Python, or R -- the Carpentries being the most prominent player.  However, few talk about integrating the pieces into a whole which is greater than the sum of its parts.  In other words, primary investigators today must not only master the technical details of the tools they use but they must also act as system designers, ensuring that workflow processes are properly designed and maintained.  It is rare that one uses a tool in isolation.  Normally a variety of tools must be configured to work together.  For example, RStudio supports the creation of projects but one also needs to track versions of project components in GitHub or a similar system. 

A distinction ought to be made between a public health **research** systems and its counterparts -- the public health information systems which underpin the epidemiological decisions made by public health professionals.  The two types of public health systems share some commonalities, but there are key differences as well.  For example, the primary users (researchers and practicing professionals) differ somewhat in their information and data needs.  For the public health professional, actionable information is of paramount importance, supported by the data.  For the public health researcher, on the other hand, a deeper level of insight and understanding is sought.  The difference might be likened to that between tactics and strategy.

### Big Data
Public health professionals, as Ola & Sedig (2014) point out, are "overwhelmed with massive amounts of data on a regular basis" and data set overload has "forced many epidemiologists to become data managers" (p. 11 & 12).  The PH informatics community has yet to address this issue in an appropriate way, especially in the data visualization space. 

Public health data is characterized by high volume, great variety, high velocity, and low veracity (Ola & Sedig, 2014, p. 3).  The same can be said of big data more generally, with the addition of velocity.  These four attributes (volume, variety, veracity, and velocity) are also referred to as the four V's of big data.

In recommendation # 5 of their article, *Transforming Epidemiology for 21st Century Medicine and Public Health*, Khoury et al (2013) write, "The development of systematic approaches to robustly manage, integrate, analyze, and interpret large complex data sets is **crucial** (p. 14).  Furthermore, the authors recognize that this challenge requires not only expertise but political acumen as well.

Technology makes it easier to search out and discover associations in big data environments.  Yet this capability also enhances the probability of "discovering" spurious correlations.  Or, as Khoury and Ioannidis (2014) warn, "Big Error can plague Big Data" (p. 1054).  Researchers have yet to figure out ways of identifying which signals are worthy of investigation and which are not.  Chasing false positives can be, and often is, extremely expensive.    

### Integrated Knowledge Management
Khoury et al (2013) favor a knowledge integration approach to "drive research, policy and practice" (p. 14).  According to the authors, "knowledge management is a continuous process of identifying, selecting, storing, curating, and tracking relevant information across disciplines" (p. 15).  This therefore entails the selection and curation of articles, systematic reviews, and meta-analysis.
