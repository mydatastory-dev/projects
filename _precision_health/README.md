Meeting (09.13.18)
  
  Meet w/Bill Hogan to discuss infrastructure
  
  Requirements gathering exercise w/researchers on the team
  
  Follow-up w/Mattia
  
In the meeting, Mattia noted that most datasets and research in this space is not "actionable."  Researchers identify correlations but then the question for the clinician remains, "How do I use this information to advise my client(s) to act in different ways?"  Tom Pearson noted that simply putting data in physician offices was an "unmitigated disaster" as they didn't know what to do with it.  Thus the research system we design needs to close the loop and include information regarding effective interventions.  Furthermore, Tom noted that the advice provided by such a system ought to be context-specific.  That is, the recommendations for a small town in West Virginia may need to be presented differently from those made in a large city context such as Miami or Orlando.

Afterwards, Tom raised the reproducibility issue.  Researchers in this space frequently discover correlations but as Mattia noted, hardly anyone validates their work.  Tom then said that doing so is an extremely expensive proposition, citing an NIH example in which the validation of a couple studies cost millions of dollars.  It appears that the bottom-line here is methodological -- i.e. we need to find ways to tease out correlations that have a greater probability of being genuine rather than spurious.

Mattias indicated that he'd like to see us build a curated data system which provides pre-built linkages between large datasets as this is a significant pain point.  Tom said that he's an "infrastructure" guy and wants us to create a system that gives UF a competitive advantage in the race for funding.
