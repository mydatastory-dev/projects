Attendees 
Sarah Meyer, Dan Maxwell, Ethan White, Scott Kostyschak, Joe Wu, Denis Valle, 
Dave Schwieder, Charles Moss, Plato Smith

Sarah reviewed the task-force charge and led the conversation of what members wanted to discuss in future meetings.  
A list of prioritized topics are listed below.

	1) Coordination of curriculum efforts
	2) Assessment of graduate student knowledge re/data science -- What is needed?
	3) Importance of domain datasets and learning experiences

Denis suggested that we create an online survey to be sent to all of the task-force members,
asking what topics they would like to discuss in future meetings.  Sarah and Dan will develop this.

Ben Toh, Justin Millar, and Shawn Taylor presented statistics and information about the
R Meetups and the Data Carpentry semester-long workshop.  

The task-force discussed the value of non-credit learning experiences and the need to support them, both
in the curriculum and financially.

Plato asked if certification might be an option.  Ethan suggested that certification might be workable
if a student structures it as a 1 hour special topics class with their faculty advisor. 
  
The meeting adjourned at 3:00 pm.
