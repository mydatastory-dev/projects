In the late 1980's, the software industry faced a programming crisis.  From the earliest days of commercial programming in the early 1960's, code had been written in a linear fashion.  This approach, however, led to increasing complexity, with programs littered with the infamous goto statement.  The result was "spaghetti code" which jumped from point to point and was virtually impossible to maintain.  The response to this crisis in the 1990's was Object-Oriented Programming, or OOP as it is called.

- Data Crisis
- Programming Crisis

The answer to the programming crisis was a new way of thinking about software development.  It involved the first two elements listed below, coupled with a disciplined approach to implementation.  These responses will probably figure prominently in solving the current data crisis.

- Systems Thinking
- Architecture
- Discipline

Often, a "crisis" is fueled by sales organizations and individuals with financial interests in solving the latest problem.  Even so, real issues develop over time, laying the groundwork for a paradigm shift, a phrase made famous by Thomas Kuhn.
