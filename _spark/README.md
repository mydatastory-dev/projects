#### Learning Modules for Hypothesis-Free Inquiry in Supercomputing Environments

1. Data discovery: This is a highly creative step in which the researcher finds datasets to place in juxtaposition to each other.
2. Data cleaning : This step prepares the data for linking.
3. Data linking  : Disparate datasets are linked, allowing relational linkages to be examined.
4. Machine analysis: A neural network is trained to discover correlations/relationships in the data.
